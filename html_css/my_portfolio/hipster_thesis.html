        <h1>Hipsters</h1>
        <p class='author'>By Harsh Patel</p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Hipster is a term popularly used to denote an international subculture primarily consisting of white millennials living in urban areas.[1][2] The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture'>subculture</a> has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s]"[3] and is broadly associated with indie and alternative music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility (including vintage and thrift store-bought clothes), generally progressive political views, organic and artisanal foods, and alternative lifestyles.[4][5][6] Hipsters are typically described as affluent or middle class young Bohemians who reside in gentrifying neighborhoods.</p>
        <h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
        <p>The term in its current usage first appeared in the 1990s and became particularly prominent in the 2010s,[9] being derived from the term used to describe earlier movements in the 1940s.[10] Members of the subculture do not self-identify as hipsters, and the word hipster is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who is pretentious,[11] overly trendy or effete.[7][12] Some analysts contend that the notion of the contemporary hipster is actually a myth created by marketing.[13]</p>
